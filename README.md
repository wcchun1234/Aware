# Aware

# Description
Aware is an immersive generative artwork using an interactive 3D word cloud within an infinity mirror box. Built with Processing and AI, it invites users to explore AI's potential in reshaping our understanding of ourselves and the world.

# Steps for creations

Step 1: Extract the text from the lecture notes (PDF files â†’ CSV files)
Step 2: Divide the sentences into single word
Step 3: Filter out the meaningless repeat words
Step 4: Do word embedding to form a 300D data of the text to show the relationship between the text visually
Step 5: Convert the 300D data to be 3D data to prepare for forming the 3D word cloud
Step 6: Form the 3D word cloud using the 3D data of the word embedded text database using Processing
